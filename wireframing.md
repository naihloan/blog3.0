[Invision video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqdn7vVKygA&t=4s) explains with examples in 3 minutes: with required buttons, CTAs, all following the main goal, mostly for the user to sign in. 

You should establish the required buttons before you start wireframing. You can list them in order of priority or other criterias, attending to the user. Then you start sketching. All is boxes and text. The difference is the thinking behind it. 

In the end, focus on the User Experience (UX) and on the visual polish later.
